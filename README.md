Participate in active AutoJudge contests, view problem descriptions, export public testcases, submit solutions, and track live standings directly inside Visual Studio Code.

## 🚀 Overview

The **AutoJudge Contest** extension allows competitive programming teams to focus on coding without context switching. It interfaces directly with the AutoJudge API from the [autojudge.io](https://autojudge.io) platform, offering a fully integrated environment to compete, submit, and succeed.

> [!TIP]
> **Perfect Pairing:** This extension works seamlessly alongside the [AutoJudge Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=autojudge.autojudge-extension) extension. Code, execute your code, and run tests cases, without ever leaving your editor.

## 🌐 Custom & Self-Hosted Contests

Hosting your own contest? AutoJudge is completely open source. You can self-host your own AutoJudge contest server using the public repository:

👉 [**@werlang/autojudge**](https://github.com/werlang/autojudge)

To connect the extension to your self-hosted server, update the `baseUrl` configuration setting to map your custom API address (defaults to `https://api.autojudge.io`).

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Settings

Customize the extension's behavior via your VS Code Settings:

| Setting Key | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `autojudgeContest.baseUrl` | `string` | `"https://api.autojudge.io"` | Full base API URL of the AutoJudge server. Supports subpaths (e.g. `https://example.com/api`). |
| `autojudgeContest.pollIntervalMs` | `number` | `5000` | The polling interval (in milliseconds) used when waiting for a submission verdict. (Min: `1000`) |
